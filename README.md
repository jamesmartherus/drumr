# drumr
Turn R into a Drum Machine

This package allows you to play drum beats from within R. At present the package contains only two working functions -- `beat`, which plays a beat from a given `kit` and `drum`, and `tempo`, which sets the spacing between beats. Admittedly, this package is basically useless, but it was fun to write. 

For an example of a tasty beat, see Example.R
